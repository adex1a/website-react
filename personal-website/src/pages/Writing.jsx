        Whether it was writing shitty poetry in elementary school, fanfiction
        and half-finished romance novels in middle school, games and memoirs in
        high school, or actually completed novels in college, I've always been a
        writer in some form or another. I've aspired to be an author or
        screenplay writer or game narrative designer at various points of my
        life, and nowadays I would love to do any combination of those things.

        I've had poetry and prose published in MIT's Journal of Arts and
        Letters, Rune Literary Magazine, and my memoir won MIT's Isabelle De
        Courtivron Writing Prize for undergraduate writing on immigrant,
        diaspora, and bicultural experiences. Some of my high school writing was
        also recognized by the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards. My game
        writing can be seen on the <NavLink to="/games">Games</NavLink> page.

        My prose fiction typically leans towards sci-fi/fantasy and romance,
        with my interests especially lying in stories that combine social
        commentary, diverse representation, and a slowburn/enemies-to-lovers
        romance. Some of my favorite books are Leigh Bardugo's Ninth House
        series and Maggie Stiefvater's Raven Cycle series. (And, of course, I
        grew up on The Hunger Games and Percy Jackson series.)
