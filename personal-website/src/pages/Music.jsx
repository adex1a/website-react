      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p className="Music-text">
        My music journey began with violin lessons in 3rd grade, and piano soon
        after. While I quit piano four years later, I continued violin
        seriously, joining several youth orchestras and attending Orange County
        School of the Arts (OCSA) in the Instrumental Music: Strings & Orchestra
        conservatory.
