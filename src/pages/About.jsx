        Currently, I am an undergraduate student at Massachusetts Institute of
        Technology majoring in course 21E (Humanities and Engineering) and
        planning to minor in 21G/Japanese. 21E is basically a
        build-your-own-major combining one humanities and one engineering degree
        program of choice. My combination is{" "}

        and Computer Science, which I chose due to my interests in video game
        development, human-computer interaction, and digital humanities. I find
        it to be the perfect program for a student as interdisciplinary as me.

        My current UROP, with Dr. Nick Montfort, who was my professor for
        Interactive Narrative. Our work in Spring '26 is focused on historical
        computational story generation systems, and reimplementing miniatures of
        them through the Narrative Nubs project for preservation, artistic, and
        research purposes. We're also working on adding new features to Dr.

        primarily programming new Curveship features (such as passive voice

        and editing papers.

        project, a series of classroom mobile games. I specifically worked on
        two of these games: Tragedy of the Commons (ToC), which was about
        resource management and environmental conservation, and the unnamed
        Source Game, which was about news misinformation. I wrote guides and
        documentation and aided in playtesting sessions for ToC, and for the
        Source Game, I helped prototype it and then implement it using
        Typescript and React. I made several important features for that game
        including a dashboard for displaying and ranking news headlines, a quiz
        mechanic for students, a page for students to review the headlines
        they've viewed, and a page for students to create and post their own
        headlines.
