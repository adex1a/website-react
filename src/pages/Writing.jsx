        Whether it was poetry, plays, short stories, games, memoirs, or novels,
        I've always been a writer in some form or another. I've aspired to be an
        author or screenplay writer or game narrative designer at various points
        of my life, and would still love to do any combination of those things.

        I've had poetry and prose published in MIT's Journal of Arts and
        Letters, Rune Literary Magazine, and my{" "}

        won MIT's Isabelle De Courtivron Writing Prize for undergraduate writing
        on immigrant, diaspora, and bicultural experiences. Some of my high
        school writing was also recognized by the Scholastic Art and Writing
        Awards. I've written many games, some of which are highlighted on the{" "}

        My prose fiction typically leans towards sci-fi/fantasy and romance,
        with my interests especially lying in stories that combine social
        commentary, diverse representation, and a slowburn/enemies-to-lovers
        romance. Some of my favorite books are Leigh Bardugo's Ninth House
        series and Maggie Stiefvater's Raven Cycle series. (And, of course, I
        grew up on the Hunger Games and Percy Jackson series.)
